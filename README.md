# LSB-Steganography
Application to use least significant bit steganography to store a string of text (ascii) in a bitmap image


Todo: 
Change to class structure.
make it function to check if long enough to store text. Must be at least 16 bits that are open, that means it has at least 128 bits. 
-> 1 bit per byte is available to be changed.

Change the actual bits
make a picture out of it again
write picture to memory


QUESTIONS:
Minimal numbers of bits must be 16 so that I can store 1 ascii char in pic?
How to write to the binary string of the image? Which bits am I supposed to change?
